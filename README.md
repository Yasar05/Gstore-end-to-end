# Overview:

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.
We need to analyze GStore customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.

# End Goal: To create an web application that can forecast revenue of the customers.
