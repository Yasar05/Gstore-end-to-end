**Overview:**

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

We need to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.
**End Goal:** To create an web application that can forecast revenue of the customers.
**Single prediction:** 
https://gstore-pred.herokuapp.com/
 
**Batch prediction:**
https://revenueprediction.herokuapp.com/
 
**Size of the data:**
Train: (903653, 55), 1.4GB
test: (804684, 53), 1.25GB
**Data type of features:**
String 30, Integer 12, Decimal 6, Other 6
**Challenges:**
Json data, Huge dataset, highly categorical data, takes time for model training and hyper parameter tuning:
**Algorithms used:**
XGBoost, Random forest, LightGBM
**HyperTuning techniques:**
RandomSearchCV, HyperOpt, Optuna
**Deployment:**
Flask, MLOps, Heroku
